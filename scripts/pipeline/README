The scripts in this directory are installed manually by CRDS developers in the
pipeline environment (particularly HST TEST) to do more atypical CRDS tasks and
debug.  The CRDS environment script in particular (crds_env.sh) is brittle
since it adapts the pipeline environment to one suitable for running SSB code
and CRDS; it's dependent on pipeline changes over which CRDS has no control and
may need updates whenever it is used.  In particular,  crds_env.sh sources
owl_login.sh which needs to be updated for each SSB release.

The other functional scripts wrap the installed crds scripts with parameter
choices as last used.
