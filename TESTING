As of version 1.7.0 (opus_2015.2-client-2) the CRDS source distribution
has been restructured to remove the "fallback cache" and to omit the
test data directory.

The ^/trunk/crds/cache directory and package has been moved to
^/branches/crds_cache_archive and contains only dirty rules.

The builtin cache has been moved to ^/branches/crds_cache_test for testing
purposes and should be set up as an independent subversion checkout one level
above this directory named "crds_cache_test".  Formally crds.cache was used as
a pristing file archive of operational rules.  Now transferred to
^/branches/crds_cache_test, the rules are no longer guaranteed to be prisitine
and may be modified to support the demands of testing.  The function of version
controlling CRDS rules is now relegated to ^/branches/crds_cache_archive which
contains only pristine production rules transcribed from the HST + JWST
archives.

Additionally, the auxilliary "crds/test/data" test data directory required to
run unit tests has been excluded from the source package distribution and is
only installable using a subversion checkout.  This directory contains crontrived
rules, reference files, and datasets for testing CRDS.

Now,  setting up CRDS to run the built-in unit tests can be accomplished as follows:

% git checkout https://github.com/spacetelescope/crds.git CRDS
% git checkout https://github.com/spacetelescope/crds-cache-test.git crds-cache-test
% cd CRDS
% source envs/hst-crds-dev.csh
% ./runtests

The above configures CRDS to run the built-in unit tests using 3 file sources:

- https://github.com/spacetelescope/crds-cache-test.git
- https://github.com/spacetelescope/crds.git   crds/tests/data
- /grp/crds/cache

/grp/crds/cache is the shared CRDS readonly cache at the Institute (currently
on the Central Store) which currently contains all rules and references for
both JWST and HST and is updated as new references arrive.

CRDS/crds/test/data is normally omitted from source code distributions.

crds-cache-test is a modified version of crds-cache-archive altered to support
unit testing requirements.   This has the unfortunate property of like-named files
with different contents.

Unit tests requiring a server are run against https://hst-crds-dev.stsci.edu
using this setup.
