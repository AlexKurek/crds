"""This module defines locking primitives for the CRDS cache used to prevent
simultaneous writes.  This is principally motivated by the JWST association
logic which may attempt to prefetch files for multiple images at the same time.

CRDS locking wraps more primitive locking functionality such as that provided by
the lockfile package or the multiprocessing module.

A number of configuration env var settings control locking behavior:

CRDS_USE_LOCKINGÂ    boolean control setting turn locks on/off
CRDS_LOCK_PATH      directory path for lock files  (must pre-exist)
CRDS_LOCKING_MODE   (filelock, lockfile, or multiprocessing)
